To prepare MATSIM input data, we need Popgen output data (person_synthetics.csv and housing_synthetics.csv). There is a complete pipeline that generates Popgen data on Cedar.

#Steps

1. Prepare a Python virtual environment by running `bash matsim_setup.sh`
2. Install the packages listed in requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. Prepare Input data and put them in a folder
4. Clone `matsim_quebec_province` with `git clone https://gitlab.com/ouassim_manout/matsim_quebec_province.git`. The repo is private. You should be a member to clone it. Ask `francesco.ciari@polymtl.ca or `ouassim.manout@entpe.fr` to have access.
5. Checkout the appropriate branch of the Gitlab repo: `montreal_EOD_2018` for example
6. Change the config file in the folder `matsim_quebec_province` to put your parameters: output folder, downsampling ratio, etc.
7. Run run_matsim.sh with `sbatch create_matsim_input.sh`

# Step 3: input data

To prepare input data you need to run in advance different pipelines. Most importantly, you need Popgen outcomes: housing_synthetic.csv and perosn_synthetic.csv. To generate these files, please refer the Pogen pipeline ReadMe file.

To locate the population, you need to create synthetic premises: `git clone https://gitlab.com/ouassim_manout/synthetic_premises.git`. The readMe file contains the details of the generation process and required input data.
