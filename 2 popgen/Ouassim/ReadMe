Popgen is used to prepare a synthetic population that matches observed sociodemographics. We use the base code deveopped by Karthik.

Popgen documentation explains required input data. Please refer to that documentation for further details.

We have developped a version of Popgen specific for Montreal. This version is available on Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/ouassim_manout/multiprocess_popgen.git. You should ask to join the repo or be invited in order to clone it. This version is capable of computing set of regions in parallel (HPC).

# Steps
1. Clone the Montreal popgen code: `git clone https://gitlab.com/ouassim_manout/multiprocess_popgen.git`.
2. Create a Python virtual envrironment with *Python 2.7*. Popgen has not been updated to work with Python 3.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. From within the `multiprocess_popgen` folder, run `pip install .`. This command installs the available setup file.
5. If you have any trouble with the specificed version of Pandas. You can download the corresponding wheels from the Pypy server and install them manually.
6. Create popgen input data and put them in a folder.
7. Edit the `configuration_one_region.yaml` file in the `seed_code` folder to specify the location of input data and other popgen parameters.
8. Get inside `seed_code` folder.
8. Create parallel jobs: `bash prepare_batch.sh numberOfNodes numberOfRegions`. For exapmle, `bash prepare_batch.sh 40 959` means that you will divide the computation of the 959 regions on 40 nodes. /!\ The script only creates the corresponding submission files in the specified folder.
9. Run parallel computation: `bash batch_runner.sh`. This command submits the jobs to the server.
10. Each job creates an output directory. To collect data, you should run `bash collect_results.sh`. This creates 2 files `housing_synthetic.csv` and `person_synthetic.csv`. These files are requireted to prapare MATSIM input data (see prepare_matsim_input_data.tar.gz on Beluga).


# Step 6: input data

Popgen needs various input data. It combines data from Census and Household Travel Survey (HTS). To prepare this data please check https://gitlab.com/ouassim_manout/popgen_input_data.git. Jupyter notebooks are available to prepare Popogen input data.
